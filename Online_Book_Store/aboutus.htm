    The Online Book Store Team
<p><b>Ruben Guerin:</b><br /><br />
Ruben Guerin is the owner of Online Book Store. He originates from The Netherlands, where he was employed for over 20-years as a draftsman and designer for Shell. After moving to the United States with his family, he made a career move from oil draftsman to cookbook seller. 
With years of collecting with his wife, browsing through hundreds of estate sales, flea markets and book stores for cookbooks, the idea sparked to turn the cookbooks into profits. And so, Cookbook Village was born. For the past several years, Ruben has been selling on eBay and Amazon and also runs a popular blog geared towards collectors.
</p>
<p><b>Wendy Guerin</b><br /><br />
Wendy Guerin, an online marketing director, gets the word out on Online Book Store and assists Ruben with blogging, 
shopping for the store's inventory and connecting with customers through social media sites where the company has a presence (Facebook, Twitter, Cookbook Collecting & Reviews blog, Google+).
 You can connect with Wendy on Google Plus.
